### Note:I started working on this project spontaneously, shortly after grasping the basics of MVC. While it might not be flawless in terms of code organization, visual appeal, efficiency, and its range of functionalities, I consider it a commendable initial effort as a beginner. My goal is to enhance its performance and incorporate additional features as I continue learning.
